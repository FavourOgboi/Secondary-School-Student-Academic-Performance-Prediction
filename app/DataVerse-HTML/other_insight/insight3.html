                <b>Students who attended school occasionally</b> had the lowest average score of 2.20, showing a notable drop in performance. This highlights that inconsistent attendance is linked to poorer academic outcomes.
                
                Regular school attendance appears to be crucial for better academic performance, with students attending every day outperforming those with less consistent attendance.</span>

            <span><b>Highest Performance with Regular Participation</b>:
                <br>
                Students who participated in extracurricular activities regularly achieved the highest average exam score of 3.29. This suggests that consistent involvement in extracurricular activities may enhance academic performance, possibly due to better time management and balanced personal development.
                <br>
                <b>Moderate Performance with Occasional Participation</b>:
                <br>
                Students who participated occasionally had an average score of 3.18, which is slightly lower than regular participants but still indicates a positive correlation between involvement in extracurricular activities and academic success.
                <br>
                <b>Lowest Performance for Non-participants</b>:
                <br>
                Students with no participation in extracurricular activities had the lowest average score of 3.13. This suggests that not engaging in extracurriculars might slightly reduce academic performance compared to those who participate, even occasionally.
                <br>
                Conclusion: Regular involvement in extracurricular activities seems to correlate with improved academic outcomes, indicating that students benefit from a balanced routine of academics and extracurricular pursuits.

                <br>
                Students who spent less than 5 hours in extracurricular activities per week achieved the highest average exam score of 3.30. This suggests that limited involvement in extracurricular activities, allowing more focus on academics, may positively impact performance.
                <br>
                <b>Moderate Performance with 5 - 10 Hours</b>:
                <br>
                Students who spent 5 to 10 hours on extracurricular activities per week had a slightly lower average score of 3.22, indicating a balance between extracurriculars and academics can still support solid academic outcomes.
                <br>
                <b>Lowest Performance with More than 10 Hours:</b>
                <br>
                Students who participated in extracurricular activities for more than 10 hours per week had the lowest average score of 2.94. This may suggest that excessive involvement in non-academic activities could hinder academic performance, possibly due to time constraints or burnout.
                <br>
                Conclusion: While some level of extracurricular participation appears beneficial, too many hours devoted to extracurriculars might negatively affect academic performance. A balanced approach is key.
